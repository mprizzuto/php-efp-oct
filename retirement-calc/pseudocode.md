# retirement calculator
- Create a program that *determines how many years you have left until retirement*   *and the year you can retire.* 
- It should **prompt for your current age** and the **age you want to retire** and display the output

## inputs
- current age
- retirement age

## processess



## outputs
<!-- valid case -->
your age is 25
you want to retire at 45
you have 20 years left to retire, its 2021 so you can retire in 2042

<!-- invalid case -->
your age is HFH. *not a num*

**invalid data**


## pseudocode
- get current year and point to currentYear

- typecast strings to ints

- initialize age, retirementYear, yearsLeftToRetire, currentYear

- only allow numbers. if user inputs anything else output error

- if user puts negative year for retirement year, output "youre already retired"

- round down numbers
