# simple math

## inputs
- numberOne and numberTwo

## processes
- add numberOne + numberTwo
- multiply numberOne * numberTwo
- subtract numberOne - numberTwo
- divide numberOne / numberTwo

## outputs
*assume numOne is 20 and numTwo is 10*
the numbers added are 30
the numbers subtracted are 10
the numbers multiplied are 200
the numbers divied are 10

## pseudcode
- only allow numerical data. 

-	if user submits anythng but numbers, output appropriate error message

- else, output the numbers with the appropriate operations applied to them

- dont allow negative numbers, output error

- initialize numberOne and numberTwo, point them to their respective form inputs

- initialize result as a  string. interperolate variables in message

assume numOne is 4 and numTwo is 2

numOne * numTwo is 8
numOne + numTwo is 6
numOne - numTwo is 2
numOne / numTwo is 2

- create functions for each mathematical function. Have them return the result of the operation

- interpolate function calls in result string. see example output above
